# Workout App

The **Workout App** is a MERN stack project that empowers users to manage their workout routines effectively. Whether you're lifting weights, doing bodyweight exercises, or practicing yoga, this app has you covered. Let's dive into the details!

## Overview

The **Workout Application** provides a seamless experience for fitness enthusiasts. It allows users to create, edit, and delete workout entries. Each workout entry includes essential information such as the workout name, load (in kilograms), and the number of repetitions.

## Features

- **Add Workouts**: Easily add new workouts by specifying the workout name, load, and repetitions.
- **Edit Workouts**: Modify existing workouts to adjust load, repetitions, or even rename them.
- **Delete Workouts**: Remove any unwanted workouts from your list.
- **Responsive UI**: The user interface is clean, intuitive, and built using React.js.
- **Backend Magic**: The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **React Query**: Simplifies data fetching, caching, and updates.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: A robust web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: Our trusty NoSQL database for storing workout data.
- **Mongoose**: The Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that bridges MongoDB and Node.js.
